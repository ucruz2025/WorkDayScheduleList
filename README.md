# WorkDayScheduleList
There were existing files for a Work-Day Schedule List that needed to be fixed. The main goal for this project was to use Web API's to help design the website, where Bootstrap was the main API used within the HTML file. Functionally speaking, it's meant to: 
    
    1. Display the regular business hours (9am-5pm)
    2. Be able to add new items to the personal work schedule using localStorage
    3. Either shows the scheduled work as "Past", "Present", or "Future"
